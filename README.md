# Play Slick Template

This template aims to accelerate the process of writing a new REST API for web application development.

The major frameworks used by this template are as follows:
- The backend and web server is provided by Play for Scala.
- Data access is simplified using Slick, a FRM (Functional Relational Mapper) and first class citizen of Play
- The front-end runs under AngularJs.

## Setup

To get this up and running, follow these simple steps.

- First, you'll need to clone the repository using Git
- then download/install the [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/) programming language 
- and the Scala Build Tool ([SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html))
- next, download/install [activator](https://www.typesafe.com/activator/download)
- finally, in your console prompt execute the command "activator run" in the root folder of the play-slick-template. This will run a local instance of the server listening on port 9000.

## Usage

To visit the front-end one page AngularJS app, visit http://localhost:9000 after you've got everything setup. The username/password for the admin login is admin@example.com/adminpass.
